    <h3>DESIGN APPROACH</h3>
 <!--    <br><img src="../img/soundSketch.jpg" width="100%">
    <br><img src="../img/soundSketch2.jpg" width="100%"><br><br> -->

<!--   <p2>Concept Design</p2> -->
    <p>
        The purpose of this project is to enhance the experience of the joy of
        singing, creating a fun and engaging experience, and to encourage
        users to enjoy and embrace their own voices. Users can enjoy the
        music and the colors that are generated according to their own
        voice, creating an immersive digital experience of sound and colors.    </p><br>
    <p>
        This project provides an immersive stage experience where
        colors on the screen react to sound (using voice input through
        microphones) and the body movement (using hand tracking) to
        change the colors on the screen and the sound output accordingly.    </p><br>
    <p>
        While the song is being played, the colors according to the musical
        notes will accumulate and blend with each other on the screen. At
        the end of the song, users will be able to see the result of all the
        colors generated by their voice, resulting in the color of their voice.    </p><br></div>

   <!--  <p2>Technical Design: Wind Chimes</p2><br>
    <br><img src="../img/chimes2.jpg" width="100%"><br>
    <p>
    There are 210 long cubes equally spaced with different piano notes individually assigned along with the script to generate sound on collision. 
    <br>
    Since the sound is an important element in the game, I wanted to implicate the importance of the sound by implementing the volume slider to adjust the volume of the sound.
    <br>
    I wanted to design the cube to make it look like glass.
    </p><br>
    <br><img src="../img/soundcube2.jpg" width="100%"><br>
    <p2>Why wind and glass?</p2><br>
    <p>
        Wind and glass are the two mediums I chose to reflect and convey the idea of Ma. 
        When wind meets glass, it generates voice to tell us about the emptiness and silence.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        <p3>Silence -> Wind -> Audio</p3> <br>
        I wanted to express silence with wind.<br>
        Wind is invisible but hearable when it makes sound. Only when it makes sound, wind becomes noticeable and we feel the presence of the wind. When wind stops, there is silence, when wind moves again, the pause is defined.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        <p3>Emptiness -> Glass -> Visual</p3><br>
    I wanted to express emptiness with glass. <br>
    It feels like glass is not there because it's clear. Glass is transparent that it reflects what is around it and projects it to its body so we can see what is around it. Glass looks blank and empty but it's there and helping us to see what is around it as well. Glass seems to me as the perfect object to show what is Ma, about perceiving the void to pay closer attention to what's around us.
    </p>

    <br><img src="../img/chimes.jpg" width="100%"><br>
    <p2>Aesthetics, Colour Palette and Sound Design</p2>
    <p>
    The main colour of the game is light pink. The background image highlights the feeling of looking at glass or crystal like materials with vivid colours so the chimes can reflect their colours.
    <br>
    The game scene does not have any other sound except the sound applied to the chimes. I wanted to also bring the feeling of simpleness and calmness with many cubes lined so evenly and uniformly.
    </p><br><br>

    <h3>REFLECTION</h3><br>
<p>
    In technical terms, there is a lot to further develop and improve. I definitely would want to include the scene of showing the whole room in the distance to show the whole cube to see how they are positioned so uniformly. I would like to adjust the controller with looking up or looking down options to enhance the experience.  I think it would be nice to be able to see how the cubes shake when it's hit, but it seems like it does not show very obviously when I play the game. I would like to fix this as well. 
<br>
But I enjoy playing this game. I enjoyed listening to the music I create with these glass cubes, specially the pauses I create with the movement. 
<br><br>
There are so many things I would like to improve technically, I’m still learning to be more comfortable with Unity and Code works. This game has definitely helped me with how there is always a gap between what I would want to design and what I can actually do in a technical way, and I learned that I need to negotiate and balance between the two. I think that is a great lesson I’ve had from this game which will affect my design from now on. I’m grateful for that.
