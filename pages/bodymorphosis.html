            PROJECT DESCRIPTION
        </h3>
        <p class="minnie__info-description">
            Humans rely on the memories they have accumulated since birth and react accordingly to these memories. How they think, their perspectives, responses, and the emotions they experience are calculated and computed by neurons formed through past memories. All these memories are gathered to form their thoughts and the system of emotions, which becomes their identity. Humans' thoughts cannot surpass their emotions. Therefore, emotions in humans are the measure of all things.
            <br><br>
            Emotion, from the perspective of quantum physics regarding the electromagnetic field inside the brain, is a form of energy, which means it is also a frequency (Idris, 2020). When humans feel something, they emit energy that can affect others, which, in turn, can affect themselves.
           <br><br>
           Even when the given experience is the same, individuals react and feel differently. 'Quantum Faces' provides the experience of AR face filters exploring emotions. This allows the audience to explore and observe their feelings, contemplate their pre-formed system of thoughts and emotions, and consider the effects of giving and receiving emotions/energy on one another.
           The main question of the project is, 'If you had the choice to affect others either positively or negatively, what would you choose?'
           <br><br>
           Quantum Faces features 4 facial sculptures named with words created by the artist. They represent feelings that do not yet have words, undefined by language. By defining them and giving names to these feelings, it offers the opportunity to process these emotions and move forward, facilitating more effective communication between people.

        “Reflethos”
        <br>
        The awareness that your mind is listening to what you are saying to yourself. 
        <br><br>
        A moment of realisation that your mind is listening to your words. It's as if you are looking at your inner consciousness as a different person, standing and staring one step away from this person. It's the moment of becoming aware of how your words hold vast and limitless power, demolishing any stereotypes, prejudices, biases, and preconceptions. It’s the feeling of being overwhelmed by the power of your words to yourself.
        <br><br>
        What are the words you have said to yourself today?
        <br><br></p>

        “Facevoir”
        <br>
        The feeling of desiring to understand your facial expressions.
        <br><br>
        It is when you realise how little attention you pay to look at yourself in the mirror and observe your facial expressions to process what you are going through. It becomes an explorative and speculative journey, an experience you have never encountered before. Your face feels stranger than ever.

        “Perspectrophe”
        <br>
        The awareness of how everyone looks at you differently. 
        <br><br>
        It is believed that every individual perceives the world differently, considering it as a part of their own reality. The sense of awareness that others have varied perceptions of you implies the existence of different versions of yourself in this world. 
        <br><br>
        Which version of yourself is the most authentic? Can any of them be considered your true self?

        “Gazenopsia”
        <br>
        The feeling of thinking that this intense eye contact will become a powerful memory of that person.
        <br><br>
        The feeling of knowing that a particular eye contact with someone will become etched in your memory, much like a vivid picture, which will remain as one of the most powerful images whenever you think about that person. It's as if you will never forget the piercing eyes of your partner or the affectionate eyes of your mother.
        <br><br>
        What sort of gazenopsia would you want to evoke?

    <h3>DESIGN APPROACH</h3><br> 

    <img src="../img/gallery3.jpg" width="100%"><br><br>

<p2>Concept Design: Wabi-sabi</p2>
      <p>
        Wabi-Sabi is a traditional Japanese philosophical term to accept the imperfection, 
        emptiness, incompleteness, and impermanence of all things because 
        <br><br><p3>
            “nothing lasts, nothing is finished, and nothing is perfect." 
            <br>("Wabi-sabi - Wikipedia", 2022)
            </p3><br><br>
        The term is applied throughout all fields of the world: architecture, art, design, technology, psychology, and etc. 
        </p><br>
       
      <p>
        Wabi-sabi I wanted to examine more in this work is about when it is applied in the philosophy of how people look at themselves. People assume that they understand how valuable they are just as they are, however, they often fall into frustration after finding out the ugly parts of themselves.
        Wabi-sabi truly reminded me that it is okay to be myself, who is far from perfection, and to embrace the imperfections as they are also the parts of myself.
        </p><br>
    
    <p2>My Wabi-sabi</p2><br>
    <p>
        This is the painting I drew at home back in 2020 during Covid-19 lockdown. It’s clearly unfinished since it’s missing legs and feet.
    </p><br>
    <img src="../img/pinkbird.jpg" width="100%"><br><br>
 
    <p>
        Going through lockdown was definitely challenging for me and I felt frustrated, troubled, helpless and lost. So I was reflecting my feelings into the painting. I painted a bird which is like a symbol of freedom, as birds fly to wherever and whenever they would like to travel. But this bird has no legs to sit down or to travel and its wings are not ready to fly as well. They look like they’re too weak to handle the weight. So now, everytime when I look at this painting, I remember how I felt so troubled and lost during that time. But I realised through examining wabi-sabi that it’s okay to feel imperfect and troubled.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        And the pink bird game offers the opportunity to reflect and meditate about the imperfections and incompleteness of ourselves by observing the pink bird with no legs. I hope the players can also think about their own “pink bird” moments to remind themselves of how it’s okay to feel imperfect and lost sometimes. 
    </p><Br>

    <p2>Technical Design: 3D model and the light switch</p2>
    <br><br><img src="../img/gallery2.jpg" width="100%"><br><br>
    <p>
        This is a website I found from researching how to create 3d models from 2d images, it’s called “Monster mash.” It was challenging to get the clean shape and details, but it is Wabi-sabi, right?
        <p><br>
        The script is written so when the player approaches the zone or the collider of the button, the text appears and the button is animated to turn on the light, it also has the switching sound embedded.
        <br><br>

    <p2>Aesthetics, Colour Palette and Sound Design</p2>
    <p>
        The painting has a vivid colour combination of pink and green which now became my all time favourite combination, not that I am new to using these colours(apparently, I’ve been using this colour combination a lot from a few years ago without realising). To focus the attention on the birds, no other colours are used in the game. 
    <br><br>
    To create a calm and relaxing atmosphere, I’ve added forest birds ambience sound effects as background audio. The audio listener is added to the player or the game controller so as it approaches the gallery, the player can listen to the sound. 
    </p><br><br>

    <h3>REFLECTION</h3><br>
<p>
    After Liam’s comment on how this game is also speaking about the digital wabi-sabi, I really liked that as well. Not only the painting, or myself are the wabi-sabi, but the 3d models as well! I think I definitely learned to be more accepting with these minor imperfections. I tend to try hard to be near to perfect but sometimes I get frustrated when things are not going as hoped. I think I learned to be more accepting of myself as well that it’s okay to make mistakes sometimes. 
<br><br>
This is the first game I created among others. Through examining wabi-sabi, I really got to think deeply about myself, especially how struggling I was for the last few years with Covid and other things going on with my life. To be honest, I was struggling a lot mentally and I was exhausted and depressed. I needed to look back to myself and find things that would help me recover. This game was an opportunity for me to deeply look inside myself and it really helped. I think I needed to accept that I was struggling and acknowledge that it’s okay to struggle sometimes. I’m grateful for the fact that I was able to find a little peace with myself through this deep dive of self-reflection.
